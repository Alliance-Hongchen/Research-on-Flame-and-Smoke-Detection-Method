# Research-on-Flame-and-Smoke-Detection-Method

### Built a 41K-image flame and smoke dataset using public sources with grayscale and rotation augmentations.

### Integrated CBAM attention into YOLOv9 (YOLOv9-CBAM), improving recognition accuracy by nearly 4%.
Model refers to: yolov9-main\models\detect\yolov9-CBAM.yaml

### Replaced backbone with MobileNetV4 (YOLOv9-MobileNetV4), reducing model complexity by nearly 10%.
Model refers to: yolov9-main\models\detect\yolov9-MobilenetV4.yaml
